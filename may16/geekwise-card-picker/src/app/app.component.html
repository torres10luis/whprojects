		<h1>Card Pick-a-matic</h1>
		<p>You just pick cards and put them back.  So fun it doesn't need to be a game.  Tell your friends.</p>

		<h3>Step 1</h3>
		<p>
			The &quot;Pick a card!&quot; button should actually do a thing or two.  Have it <b>draw a card from a deck</b>!  To do this,
			you will need to instantiate a <code>Deck</code> from the <code>Deck</code> class.  Don't do this on every click.  Although you
			might draw cards from multiple decks or combine multiple decks into one, it's probably best to just use one.
		</p>
		<p>
			The card drawn should <b>show somewhere</b>.
		</p>

		<h3>Step 2</h3>
		<p>
			Don't just draw and toss.  That's reckless and bad for the environment.  Let's <b>make a user's hand</b> (<code>ICard[]</code>).  Store the cards
			we draw from the deck and show them using fancy Angular stuff.  Now's the time to shine.
		</p>
		<p>
			Use the <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> with class <code>card-in-hand</code>.  Be one with your Angular structural directives.
		</p>

		<h3>Step 3</h3>
		<p>
			Each card should have a button that, when clicked, <b>sends the card back</b> into the deck from whence it came.
		</p>

		<h3>Step 4</h3>
		<p>
			Your <code>Deck</code> instance <b>should have a life bar</b> so you don't accidentally kill it.  As you remove cards from the deck, present a
			rectangle (bar) that shrinks and changes color to something dangerousy.  Make it look healthy again if cards are returned to the deck.
		</p>

		<h3>Step 5</h3>
		<p>
			Finished early?  <b>Polish</b>.
		</p>
		<p>
			Disable the &quot;Pick a card!&quot; button when there's no more cards to draw. <b>Style your cards</b> and maybe the space they
			chill.  Make them look good.  Add to your GitHub for more job-cred.
